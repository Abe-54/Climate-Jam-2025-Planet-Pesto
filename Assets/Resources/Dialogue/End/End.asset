    - I have returned.

    pharagraphs:
    - "Welcome home, are you ok? I hope it wasn\u2019t too bad out there."
  - speakerName: Olean
    pharagraphs:
    - "You worried me half to death, I swear if Alina hadn\u2019t convinced me to
      stay I would have gone out and..."
    - "well I don\u2019t have any plants to fight fire but I could certainly throw
      a couple watermelons at it."
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - I am fine, there were fires, bad ones although I believe I now know the cause.
    - The smoke from the factories, it is releasing something into the air, and trapping
      more heat in the air.
    - I also do not believe watermelons contain enough water to sufficiently put
      out a flame.
  - speakerName: Olean
    pharagraphs:
    - Not yet they don't.
  - speakerName: Alina
    pharagraphs:
    - "The factories? Well that ain\u2019t gonna be easy, I don\u2019t see them shutting
      down anytime soon. Maybe we can go to city hall, try to let the officials know. "
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - 'There is more though, when I was returning I saw people. They had been affected
      by the fires. Some had lost things and some had been hurt in more ways than
      simply physical. All of them seemed scared and confused. '
  - speakerName: Alina
    pharagraphs:
    - And what did you do?
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - Nothing, I simply observed I did not feel I could help with their distress
      like I could yours.
  - speakerName: Alina
    pharagraphs:
    - I.R.I.S I gave you have more than just your eyes. I gave you hands to reach
      out to others and a voice to speak to them.
    - I am sure if they knew the reasons for the fires they would try to find ways
      to prevent them from happening again.
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - I see I will do my best next time to undistress their stress
  - speakerName: Olean
    pharagraphs:
    - "Your best is all you can do, and if it isn\u2019t enough just remember you're
      never alone."
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - "I am physically incapable of forgetting anything, so I won\u2019t...I suppose"
  - speakerName: Alina
    pharagraphs:
    - "Alright it\u2019s the suns gone to bed and so should we."
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - Oh I also believe the planet might be a living dinosaurs.
  - speakerName: Alina
