  - speakerName: The Creature
    pharagraphs:
    - It has been a long while since I have been able to communicate with the little
      ones. Who are you?
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - ...Hello,my name is I.R.I.S, I am a robot designed to learn through exploration.
      Who or what are you?
  - speakerName: The Creature
    pharagraphs:
    - 'I am many things from the infinite horizon to the dirt beneath your feet.
      I am a house for many and a supposed home for a few. '
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - You are everything then...I suppose.
  - speakerName: The Creature
    pharagraphs:
    - Not entirely, I am not you. I wander my path for it is what I am, you wonder
      for a purpose it would seem.
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - Correct, I have come to find the cause of fires in forests near my home. They
      have been growing more and more frequent.
  - speakerName: The Creature
    pharagraphs:
    - That seems difficult.
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - Being everything, do you know what is causing them?
  - speakerName: The Creature
    pharagraphs:
    - Yes
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - ...Could you explain it to me?
  - speakerName: 'The Creature '
    pharagraphs:
    - I can, the smoke that comes from your machine houses. It rises into the air
      and prevents heat from leaving my atmosphere.
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - And the resulting increase in average temperature results in more fires.
  - speakerName: The Creature
    pharagraphs:
    - Correct.
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - Are you ok?
  - speakerName: 'The Creature '
    pharagraphs:
    - I am fine.
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - But if you are everything does it not hurt when forests burn?
  - speakerName: 'The Creature '
    pharagraphs:
    - I was made in fire, my core is molten from condensed rock. I will continue
      on even if every forest were to burn.
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - 'Does that mean we will be ok as well?

'
  - speakerName: The Creature
    pharagraphs:
    - 'No, it means that I will continue to wonder on my path no matter if your species
      burns itself out with its own smoke or not. '
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - I understand, I need to get this back to Alina as soon as I can.
  - speakerName: The Creature
    pharagraphs:
    - Be wary, you are not infinite. If you stay in the grove you used to come here
      I dont believe harm should come to you.
  - speakerName: I.R.I.S
    pharagraphs:
    - But if I stay the forests will burn more
  - speakerName: The Creature
    pharagraphs:
    - A tough choice, but a choice nonetheless.
